  Our project is a standard text editor, implemented in OCaml. The user can
  input commands that allow them to create, read, and write to files. The
  user has many shortcuts available to them inside our editor that make it
  easier and more efficient to move around and edit files. Also, they can
  make use of our editor's various "modes" each of which feature certain
  functionality tailored to some common use cases.
